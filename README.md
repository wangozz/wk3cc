# Restaurant Reviews

This project focuses on building a system to manage restaurant reviews. It includes three main models: `Restaurant`, `Review`, and `Customer`. A `Restaurant` can have multiple reviews, a `Customer` can leave multiple reviews, and a `Review` belongs to both a `Restaurant` and a `Customer`. The relationship between `Restaurant` and `Customer` is many-to-many.
